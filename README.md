# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)

An end-to-end ANPR pipeline using YOLOv8 for license plate detection
and TrOCR for text recognition.

## Overview
The project focuses on understanding object detection, OCR integration,
and accuracy challenges in real-world ANPR systems.

## Pipeline
Input Image → YOLOv8 Detection → Plate Cropping → TrOCR OCR → Text Output

## Status
Detection and OCR components implemented independently.
End-to-end accuracy optimization is ongoing.
